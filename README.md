#Meme App Editor

This is a simple part of Meme Generator App. This app is not completed yet but still you can create meme. Obviously, There is lot's of bugs and error, Please let me know if you found any.
For Experiment purpose, I've added only 4/6 templates, I know which is not sufficient. I hope soon I can finish this project. Feel free to contribute. 

###Tools used
First I tried to make this project with Vanilla Javascript, But to save time and afford I had to use `Jquery`. As well as I have used `Fabric.js` which is one of the powerfull Canvas Library which makes things more easy than Html Canvas itself. Then I also used `Hammer.Js` to handle Drag, Drop, Pan features
